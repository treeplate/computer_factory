I just discovered this project, and am very confused.
The behaviour appears to be three independent people 
(farmer,miner,woodcutter), but the README contradicts that.
It says there are four people:
- one that farms cows and sheep (current farmer is only cows)
and gives them to #2,
- which makes boxes that are sold to #4 
out of wood traded for cows and sheep from #3,
- which chops wood and turns that into planks
- and #4 mines gold to craft coins to buy boxes from #2
Also, while looking around, I found a comment in manager.dart,
which says the same thing but #2 is split into #2-#5, 
and lists #3 and #4 as one person referred to as "us".
The manager seems to have support for all these features, 
and it's well documented in the README, 
but nobody seems to use it?
I have no idea what's going on here. 
Did this work before but then I made it simpler? Surely not.
Did I write this description and then not implement it?
I doubt that too, because the README and manager.dart disagree
on the details in a way that would be weird if it was all
just hypothetical.
Also, after commiting this to github I made a commit to fix a
formatting error in the readme, so it would be weird if I
didn't at least put a note about the "behaviour" section
just being wrong, which it definitely was because as of that
commit the README and implementation were definitely inconsistent
(i.e. only tangentially related)
Past self, please explain.
I should probably be going to bed (it's 21:16) but no i'm going
to spend the next however long implementing this (reimplementing??)
because I want to see this code do what the readme says it does.
